<!-- Function -->
<!-- has 2 parts
    1 function definiton
    2 function body 

    funtion invocation/call is caled same way you declare the function
    parameterless function is a function that does not have a parameter
    to invoke a parameterlized function you have to pass in the same number of parameters when it was declared 
    calling it it is called argument
    function with default values => is set a predefined values to the parameter
    create function that returns value => no statement gets executed after a return statement
